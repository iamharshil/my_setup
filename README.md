# My Setup
----------------
- First thing i am using is Kitty terminal which is recommended by my friend [Neil](https://github.com/nd28).
- I use "bash", "fish" and "nvim" for all kind of work.
- There are many other tools which I use.
### BASH
-   [Synth-Shell](https://github.com/andresgongora/synth-shell) - i use synth-shell prompt for my bash so that it looks good.
### FISH
- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) - Fisher is package manager for fish which is very easy to use and there are lot of packages inside it.
- [POWERLINE-SHELL](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell) - powerline-shell is another prompt which i use for fish.

### TOOLS
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Fzf is file searching tool.
- [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z/) - Z is for changing directory without giving path it uses our history to navigate us to the recent files we use.
- [PECO](https://github.com/peco/peco) - Peco is filter tool.
- [EXA](https://the.exa.website/) - Exa is modern ls command with good color scheme.
